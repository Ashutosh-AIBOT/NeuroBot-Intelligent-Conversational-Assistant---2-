The ﬁeld of machine learning has taken a dramatic twist in re-\ncent times, with the rise of the Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN). These\nbiologically inspired computational models are able to far exceed the per-\nformance of previous forms of artiﬁcial intelligence in common machine\nlearning tasks. One of the most impressive forms of ANN architecture is\nthat of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are primarily\nused to solve difﬁcult image-driven pattern recognition tasks and with\ntheir precise yet simple architecture, offers a simpliﬁed method of getting\nstarted with ANNs.\nThis document provides a brief introduction to CNNs, discussing recently\npublished papers and newly formed techniques in developing these bril-\nliantly fantastic image recognition models. This introduction assumes you\nare familiar with the fundamentals of ANNs and machine learning.\nKeywords: Pattern recognition, artiﬁcial neural networks, machine learn-\ning, image analysis\n1\nIntroduction\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational processing systems of\nwhich are heavily inspired by way biological nervous systems (such as the hu-\nman brain) operate. ANNs are mainly comprised of a high number of intercon-\nnected computational nodes (referred to as neurons), of which work entwine in\na distributed fashion to collectively learn from the input in order to optimise its\nﬁnal output.\nThe basic structure of a ANN can be modelled as shown in Figure 1. We would\nload the input, usually in the form of a multidimensional vector to the input\nlayer of which will distribute it to the hidden layers. The hidden layers will then\nmake decisions from the previous layer and weigh up how a stochastic change\nwithin itself detriments or improves the ﬁnal output, and this is referred to as\nthe process of learning. Having multiple hidden layers stacked upon each-other\nis commonly called deep learning.\narXiv:1511.08458v2  [cs.NE]  2 Dec 2015"

This structure is the basis\nof a number of common ANN architectures, included but not limited to Feed-\nforward Neural Networks (FNN), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\nThe two key learning paradigms in image processing tasks are supervised and\nunsupervised learning. Supervised learning is learning through pre-labelled\ninputs, which act as targets. For each training example there will be a set of\ninput values (vectors) and one or more associated designated output values.\nThe goal of this form of training is to reduce the models overall classiﬁcation\nerror, through correct calculation of the output value of training example by\ntraining.\nUnsupervised learning differs in that the training set does not include any la-\nbels. Success is usually determined by whether the network is able to reduce or\nincrease an associated cost function. However, it is important to note that most\nimage-focused pattern-recognition tasks usually depend on classiﬁcation using\nsupervised learning.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are analogous to traditional ANNs\nin that they are comprised of neurons that self-optimise through learning. Each\nneuron will still receive an input and perform a operation (such as a scalar\nproduct followed by a non-linear function) - the basis of countless ANNs. From\nthe input raw image vectors to the ﬁnal output of the class score, the entire of\nthe network will still express a single perceptive score function (the weight).\nThe last layer will contain loss functions associated with the classes, and all of\nthe regular tips and tricks developed for traditional ANNs still apply.\nThe only notable difference between CNNs and traditional ANNs is that CNNs\nare primarily used in the ﬁeld of pattern recognition within images. This allows\nus to encode image-speciﬁc features into the architecture, making the network"

With this dataset a single neuron in\nthe ﬁrst hidden layer will contain 784 weights (28×28×1 where 1 bare in mind\nthat MNIST is normalised to just black and white values), which is manageable\nfor most forms of ANN.\nIf you consider a more substantial coloured image input of 64 × 64, the number\nof weights on just a single neuron of the ﬁrst layer increases substantially to\n12, 288. Also take into account that to deal with this scale of input, the network\nwill also need to be a lot larger than one used to classify colour-normalised\nMNIST digits, then you will understand the drawbacks of using such models.\n1.1\nOverﬁtting\nBut why does it matter? Surely we could just increase the number of hidden lay-\ners in our network, and perhaps increase the number of neurons within them?\nThe simple answer to this question is no. This is down to two reasons, one be-\ning the simple problem of not having unlimited computational power and time\nto train these huge ANNs.\nThe second reason is stopping or reducing the effects of overﬁtting. Overﬁtting\nis basically when a network is unable to learn effectively due to a number of\nreasons. It is an important concept of most, if not all machine learning algo-\nrithms and it is important that every precaution is taken as to reduce its effects.\nIf our models were to exhibit signs of overﬁtting then we may see a reduced\nability to pinpoint generalised features for not only our training dataset, but\nalso our test and prediction sets.\nThis is the main reason behind reducing the complexity of our ANNs. The less\nparameters required to train, the less likely the network will overﬁt - and of\ncourse, improve the predictive performance of the model.\n2\nCNN architecture\nAs noted earlier, CNNs primarily focus on the basis that the input will be com-\nprised of images. This focuses the architecture to be set up in way to best suit\nthe need for dealing with the speciﬁc type of data."

The depth does not\nrefer to the total number of layers within the ANN, but the third dimension of a\nactivation volume. Unlike standard ANNS, the neurons within any given layer\nwill only connect to a small region of the layer preceding it.\nIn practice this would mean that for the example given earlier, the input ’vol-\nume’ will have a dimensionality of 64 × 64 × 3 (height, width and depth), lead-\ning to a ﬁnal output layer comprised of a dimensionality of 1 × 1 × n (where\nn represents the possible number of classes) as we would have condensed the\nfull input dimensionality into a smaller volume of class scores ﬁled across the\ndepth dimension.\n2.1\nOverall architecture\nCNNs are comprised of three types of layers. These are convolutional layers,\npooling layers and fully-connected layers. When these layers are stacked, a\nCNN architecture has been formed.

The fully-connected layers will then perform the same duties found in\nstandard ANNs and attempt to produce class scores from the activations,\nto be used for classiﬁcation. It is also suggested that ReLu may be used\nbetween these layers, as to improve performance.\nThrough this simple method of transformation, CNNs are able to transform\nthe original input layer by layer using convolutional and downsampling tech-\nniques to produce class scores for classiﬁcation and regression purposes.\nFig. 3: Activations taken from the ﬁrst convolutional layer of a simplistic deep\nCNN, after training on the MNIST database of handwritten digits.

When the data hits a convolutional layer,\nthe layer convolves each ﬁlter across the spatial dimensionality of the input to\nproduce a 2D activation map. These activation maps can be visualised, as seen\nin Figure 3.\nAs we glide through the input, the scalar product is calculated for each value in\nthat kernel. (Figure 4) From this the network will learn kernels that ’ﬁre’ when\nthey see a speciﬁc feature at a given spatial position of the input. These are\ncommonly known as activations.\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n2\n0\n1\n1\n4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n-4\n-8\nPooled Vector\nKernel\nDestination Pixel\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n2\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\nInput Vector\nFig. 4: A visual representation of a convolutional layer. The centre element of the\nkernel is placed over the input vector, of which is then calculated and replaced\nwith a weighted sum of itself and any nearby pixels.\nEvery kernel will have a corresponding activation map, of which will be stacked\nalong the depth dimension to form the full output volume from the convolu-\ntional layer.\nAs we alluded to earlier, training ANNs on inputs such as images results in\nmodels of which are too big to train effectively. This comes down to the fully-\nconnected manner of standard ANN neurons, so to mitigate against this every\nneuron in a convolutional layer is only connected to small region of the input\nvolume. The dimensionality of this region is commonly referred to as the re-\nceptive ﬁeld size of the neuron. The magnitude of the connectivity through the\ndepth is nearly always equal to the depth of the input.\nFor example, if the input to the network is an image of size 64 × 64 × 3 (a RGB-\ncoloured image with a dimensionality of 64 × 64) and we set the receptive ﬁeld\nsize as 6 × 6, we would have a total of 108 weights on each neuron within the\nconvolutional layer. (6 × 6 × 3 where 3 is the magnitude of connectivity across\nthe depth of the volume) To put this into perspective, a standard neuron seen\nin other forms of ANN would contain 12, 288 weights each.\nConvolutional layers are also able to signiﬁcantly reduce the complexity of the\nmodel through the optimisation of its output. These are optimised through\nthree hyperparameters, the depth, the stride and setting zero-padding."

This can be seen with other forms of ANNs, where the\nall of the neurons in the hidden layer are directly connected to every single\nneuron beforehand. Reducing this hyperparameter can signiﬁcantly minimise\nthe total number of neurons of the network, but it can also signiﬁcantly reduce\nthe pattern recognition capabilities of the model.\nWe are also able to deﬁne the stride in which we set the depth around the spatial\ndimensionality of the input in order to place the receptive ﬁeld. For example if\nwe were to set a stride as 1, then we would have a heavily overlapped receptive\nﬁeld producing extremely large activations. Alternatively, setting the stride to a\ngreater number will reduce the amount of overlapping and produce an output\nof lower spatial dimensions.\nZero-padding is the simple process of padding the border of the input, and\nis an effective method to give further control as to the dimensionality of the\noutput volumes.\nIt is important to understand that through using these techniques, we will alter\nthe spatial dimensionality of the convolutional layers output. To calculate this,\nyou can make use of the following formula:\n(V −R) + 2Z\nS + 1\nWhere V represents the input volume size (height×width×depth), R represents\nthe receptive ﬁeld size, Z is the amount of zero padding set and S referring to\nthe stride. If the calculated result from this equation is not equal to a whole\ninteger then the stride has been incorrectly set, as the neurons will be unable to\nﬁt neatly across the given input.\nDespite our best efforts so far we will still ﬁnd that our models are still enor-\nmous if we use an image input of any real dimensionality. However, methods\nhave been developed as to greatly curtail the overall number of parameters\nwithin the convolutional layer.\nParameter sharing works on the assumption that if one region feature is useful\nto compute at a set spatial region, then it is likely to be useful in another region.\nIf we constrain each individual activation map within the output volume to the\nsame weights and bias, then we will see a massive reduction in the number of\nparameters being produced by the convolutional layer.\nAs a result of this as the backpropagation stage occurs, each neuron in the out-\nput will represent the overall gradient of which can be totalled across the depth\n- thus only updating a single set of weights, as opposed to every single one."

In most CNNs, these come in the\nform of max-pooling layers with kernels of a dimensionality of 2 × 2 applied\nwith a stride of 2 along the spatial dimensions of the input. This scales the\nactivation map down to 25% of the original size - whilst maintaining the depth\nvolume to its standard size.\nDue to the destructive nature of the pooling layer, there are only two generally\nobserved methods of max-pooling. Usually, the stride and ﬁlters of the pooling\nlayers are both set to 2 × 2, which will allow the layer to extend through the\nentirety of the spatial dimensionality of the input. Furthermore overlapping\npooling may be utilised, where the stride is set to 2 with a kernel size set to\n3. Due to the destructive nature of pooling, having a kernel size above 3 will\nusually greatly decrease the performance of the model.\nIt is also important to understand that beyond max-pooling, CNN architectures\nmay contain general-pooling. General pooling layers are comprised of pooling\nneurons that are able to perform a multitude of common operations including\nL1/L2-normalisation, and average pooling. However, this tutorial will primar-\nily focus on the use of max-pooling.\n2.4\nFully-connected layer\nThe fully-connected layer contains neurons of which are directly connected to\nthe neurons in the two adjacent layers, without being connected to any layers\nwithin them. This is analogous to way that neurons are arranged in traditional\nforms of ANN. (Figure 1)\n3\nRecipes\nDespite the relatively small number of layers required to form a CNN, there\nis no set way of formulating a CNN architecture. That being said, it would be\nidiotic to simply throw a few of layers together and expect it to work. Through\nreading of related literature it is obvious that much like other forms of ANNs,\nCNNs tend to follow a common architecture. This common architecture is illus-\ntrated in Figure 2, where convolutional layers are stacked, followed by pooling\nlayers in a repeated manner before feeding forward to fully-connected layers."

This is to reduce the amount of computational complexity\nwithin a given convolutional layer. For example, if you were to stack three con-\nvolutional layers on top of each other with a receptive ﬁeld of 3×3. Each neuron\nof the ﬁrst convolutional layer will have a 3×3 view of the input vector. A neu-\nron on the second convolutional layer will then have a 5 × 5 view of the input\nvector. A neuron on the third convolutional layer will then have a 7 × 7 view of\nthe input vector. As these stacks feature non-linearities which in turn allows us\nto express stronger features of the input with fewer parameters. However, it is\nimportant to understand that this does come with a distinct memory allocation\nproblem - especially when making use of the backpropagation algorithm.\nThe input layer should be recursively divisible by two. Common numbers in-\nclude 32 × 32, 64 × 64, 96 × 96, 128 × 128 and 224 × 224.\nWhilst using small ﬁlters, set stride to one and make use of zero-padding as to\nensure that the convolutional layers do not reconﬁgure any of the dimension-\nality of the input. The amount of zero-padding to be used should be calculated\nby taking one away from the receptive ﬁeld size and dividing by two.activation\nCNNs are extremely powerful machine learning algorithms, however they can\nbe horrendously resource-heavy.
